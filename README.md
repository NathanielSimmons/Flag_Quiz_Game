**Description**

I am in the process of developing an educational game aimed at enhancing players' recall of world flags. The inspiration for this project struck me while watching a TikTok video, wherein participants were tested on their knowledge of global flags. Surprisingly, I managed to correctly identify only four out of the twenty flags featured in the video. This realization sparked the idea to create an engaging platform that seamlessly combines learning with entertainment. The game aims to provide users with a space to broaden their understanding of world flags while having an enjoyable and enriching experience.
