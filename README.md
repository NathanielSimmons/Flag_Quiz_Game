**Description**

I developed an educational game aimed at helping players' recall the flags of the world. I was inpired by a TikTok where participants were tested on their knowledge of global flags. Surprisingly, I managed to correctly identify only four out of the twenty flags featured in the video. This realization sparked the idea to create an engaging game where learning is combined with entertainment. The game aims to provide users with a space to broaden their understanding of world flags while having an enjoyable experience.
